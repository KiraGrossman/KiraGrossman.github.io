# Description



# Design

**Structure and External Parts**
* The sword is an original design loosely based off of the sword Excalibur. 
* The sword was split into three external parts to account for the dimensions of the FFF printer and to minimize the amount of support material used. 

**Internal Parts**
* There are two internal parts to connect the three external parts into a mechanically stable sword. 
* The internal parts are rectangular prisms to avoid rotation of the external parts.
* The internal parts were secured to the external parts with super glue and epoxy.

**Facade**
* The sword has the words "Go Dores" debossed into the exterior of one side of the blade. This was for school spirit and dramatic effect in the competition.
* The entire sword was coated in automotive primer to allow for other paints to stick to the sword. The base, cross-guard, and debossed letters were painted black, the handle had faux-leather adhered to it with super glue, and the blade was painted silver and buffed with silver wax finish.

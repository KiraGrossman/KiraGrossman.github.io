# Importance of Play

Children, according to the United Nations, have the inherent right to play, yet toys that require fine motor skills and able bodies in order to play exclude children with disabilities from this play. Therefore, the toys must be redesigned in order to eliminate the components that pose physical issues for children with disabilities. 

# User-Centered Design

The child the device was made for was affected by Spina bifida, a birth defect that causes the spine and spinal cord to not form properly, often affecting the nerves that control the lower limbs. Spina bifida causes weakness and sometimes paralysis in the lower limbs, resulting in the user being unable to press down on the gas pedal of a toy car and her having difficulty reaching out and steering the car. Thus, three major modifications were made to a battery operated BMW i8 Coupe:

1. The gas pedal was rendered dysfunctional by cutting the connecting wires and replacing it with a functional button underneath the steering wheel so that when pressure is applied to the steering wheel with the upper body, the button is pressed and the car moves. This eliminates the need for strength in the lower limbs to make the car function.
2. The existing steering wheel was replaced with a larger, easier to grab and maneuver steering wheel.
3. A potentiometer was installed into the circuitry of the motor to allow for parental control of the speed of the car.

# Electrical Modifications

| Part | Modification |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Gas Pedal | The wire between the gas pedal and controller was cut. A new wire attached to a new button was then attached to the controller to act as the gas pedal. |
| Potentiometer | A potentiometer was added to allow parental control of the speed of the car. The potentiometer was attached to the circuit underneath the seat of the car. The wires connecting the motor to the controller were cut and reattached to the potentiometer. The potentiometer was then wired to the controller and the gas pedal wires. |

# Mechanical Modifications

| Part | Modification |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Steering Wheel | The original car had a circular steering wheel close to the dashboard. This steering wheel was cut in half and modified with PCV pipes to create a new steering wheel. PVC pipers were formed into a rectangle with a pipe down the middle. The PVC rectangle was then screwed onto the back half of the existing steering wheel. The PVC pipe steering wheel was added to the car to allow for a larger steering wheel that is easier to grip for the patient. |
| New "Gas Pedal" Button | The button was inserted and secured with screws into the middle gap of the modified steering wheel. The button is in a gap in the back half of the original steering wheel and underneath the PCV pipe component of the modified steering wheel. The PCV pipe rests on the button so that when a force is applied, the button is engaged and the car moves. The button was placed on the steering wheel as the patient has weakness in the lower limbs and would have difficulty pressing the original gas pedal with their foot. Thus, the modified gas pedal is controlled with the upper body by pressing down on the PCV pipe steering wheel with the arms. |
| Potentiometer Dial | A dial was added to the rear of the car that connects to the potentiometer. The dial changes the maximum speed the car can move at. |

# Table of Standards

| Specific Section of the ASTM F963-17 Standard | How Standard is met |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 4.14.1 | There is no external wiring that the child can touch. All wiring is on the inside of the car, protected by the plastic of the car and not accessible to the child. |
| 4.14.1.1 | Wires were secured to the plastic of the car with hot glue to prevent entanglement, and wires can be pulled from their connection points for a functional breakaway. |
| 4.25.4 | Toy requires a screwdriver to access the battery. |
| 4.25.10.8 | There are no external wires. Internal wires are connected to the car itself with hot glue, providing strain relief. |
| 4.25.3 | Heat shrink was placed over all soldered wires so there are no exposed wires. |

# Importance

Small, inaccessible buttons on toys exclude children who do not have the motor skills to press the button, such as children with arthrogryposis. Arthrogryposis causes stiffness and muscle weakness and children with arthrogryposis do not have the ability to hold a toy and press the small buttons. Thus, toys need to be more accessible to children with disabilities, especially as play is essential for childrenâ€™s growth and development. Children with disabilities need to play with toys that they can use independently, and to do this, a large, sensitive, external button that functions in the same manner as the inaccessible button on the toy was attached to a toy. This created a low-cost option to consumers and allows for all children to use they toy in a fun and safe manner. 

# Previous Solutions and Shortcomings

* **Buddy Button by AbleNet:** Requires the toy to have a female port and is expensive.
* **Switch modified toys:** Toys and accessible buttons are often sold separately and are expensive.

# Modifications

* Wires connecting the music button to the circuit board were cut and new wires connected to a female connector were soldered to the circuit board
* A large, accessible button was wired into a box and connected to the female connector

# Table of Standards

| Specific Section of the ASTM F963-17 Standard | How Standard is met |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 4.14.1 | Cord is seven inches long on the exterior of the toy. |
| 4.14.1.1 | The cord is a male wire connected to a female port and thus the cord connection can be disconnected easily. |
| 4.25.4 | Toy requires a screwdriver to access the batteries. |
| 4.25.10.8 | On the external button, a plastic strain relief cord connector provides strain relief to one end of the wire. On the toy, hot glue connecting the wire to the toy provides strain relief. |
| 4.25.3 | Heat shrink was placed over all soldered wires so there are no exposed wires. |

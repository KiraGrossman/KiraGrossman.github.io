# Problem Statement
A way to address the **human error, contamination, and long turnaround times** that occur from the **incompatibility** between pediatric blood tubes and automation equipment by modifying the pediatric tubes so that VUMC medical staff and researchers do not have to manually aliquot the sample into a compatible tube.


# Solution Statement
Our proposed solution is a pediatric blood collection tube designed to bridge the gap between current pediatric tubes and the automation systems commonly used in hospitals, specifically at VUMC. 

* The key feature of our design is a dual-geometry structure: 
  * The external geometry mirrors that of an adult-sized tube, allowing seamless compatibility with automated laboratory equipment. This eliminates the need for manual aliquoting, a process that not only increases the risk of human error and contamination but also contributes to longer turnaround times for test results.
  * Internally, the tube is designed to maintain the same volume capacity as current pediatric tubes, ensuring that blood samples collected from pediatric patients remain appropriate for their needs. 

By creating a tube with this dual-geometry structure, we ensure that the sample size is optimized for pediatric use while making it compatible with existing hospital infrastructure. 

Additionally, this design reduces the handling of samples, decreasing the risk of contamination and improving overall efficiency in clinical workflows. Our solution addresses these critical issues, providing a more reliable, streamlined process for both medical staff and researchers.


# Product Development Steps


# Product Classification for FDA Regulated Products
* Our product is regulated by the FDA as a Medical Device Class II
* * This classification is due to the handling of biological specimens which presents a moderate risk level that requires performance standards for safety and effectiveness
* * There is moderate risk due to the negative pressure that must be maintained inside the tube, which is regulated to pediatric patients
* * This Class II medical device is also not at high risk, i.e. heart stent, which would require another level of invasiveness and category of safety measures/testing


# Regulator Pathway Description
We plan to pursue the 510(k) Premarket Notification pathway for our product. This best suits our product since it is substantially equivalent to some existing pediatric blood test tubes and related automated specimen-handling devices on the market. This pathway would allow us to demonstrate that our product is at least as safe and effective as a legally marketed device without requiring extensive clinical trials.


# Overview of R&D Strategy
1. Bench (Cell Biocompatibility tests, Mechanical Tests, etc.)
  * Perform **ASTM F1980** to evaluate accelerated aging effects on plastic tube materials and ensure structural integrity over expected shelf life.
  * Conduct **ISO 10993-5** tests to evaluate the cytotoxicity of materials that come in contact with blood samples.
  * Carry out **ISO 6710** compatibility testing for sterility to confirm that the product meets requirements for blood specimen collection devices.
2. Animal
  * Test the biocompatibility using small animal models to ensure there are no adverse effects when blood collected using these tubes is analyzed.
3. Human
  * After approval, conduct clinical simulation to evaluate product performance and ease of use. Monitor technician handling, error rate, and efficiency improvements.

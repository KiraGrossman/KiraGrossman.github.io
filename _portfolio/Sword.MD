# Description

Mechanically stable, light-weight, easy-to-assemble sword! This sword was used as a prop by Vanderbilt Mascot Mr. Commodore (Mr. C) to win 2nd place at the National Dance Alliance Mascot Competition in 2025.

* **Mechanically Stable:** Even though the sword is a whopping 5 feet tall, it is stable and can be moved and handled without parts shaking or bending due to gravity!
* **Light-weight:** Made of PLA the sword, despite its size, is light-weight, durable, and easy to handle. 
* **Easy-to-Assemble:** With only 5 easy-to-understand parts, the sword could be assembled by anyone!

# Design

**Structure and External Parts**
* The sword is an original design loosely based off of the sword Excalibur. 
* The sword was split into three external parts to account for the dimensions of the FFF printer and to minimize the amount of support material used. 

**Internal Parts**
* There are two internal parts to connect the three external parts into a mechanically stable sword. 
* The internal parts are rectangular prisms to avoid rotation of the external parts.
* The internal parts were secured to the external parts with super glue and epoxy.

**Facade**
* The sword has the words "Go Dores" debossed into the exterior of one side of the blade. This was for school spirit and dramatic effect in the competition.
* The entire sword was coated in automotive primer to allow for other paints to stick to the sword. The base, crossguard, and depossed letters were painted black, the handle had faux-leather adhered to it with super glue, and the blade was painted silver and buffed with silver wax finish.

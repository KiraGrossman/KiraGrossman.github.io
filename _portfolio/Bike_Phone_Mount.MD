# Design Rationale

![Labeled_Design](/assets/img/PFF_Drawing.jpg)


| Part                | Material | Rationale |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | 
| Top Clamp |  | Nylon |
| Bottom Clamp |  | Nylon |
| Rotator |  | PLA |
| Spring-Loaded Knobs |  | Nylon |
| Cap |  | Nylon |
| Base |  | Nylon |
| Spur Gear |  | Nylon |
| Holder (x2) |  | PLA |

# Assembly Instructions
M5 x 15 mm screws --> clamp
M3 x 15 mm screw --> rotator
1. Add 4 M5 brass knurled nuts (heat-set inserts) to all holes in the Bottom Clamp.
2. Add 4 M5 brass knurled nuts (heat-set inserts) to 4 holes on the round face of the Top Clamp.
3. Add 1 M3 brass knurled nuts (heat-set insert) to the hole in the Rotator.
4. Add 1 M3 brass knurled nuts (heat-set insert) to the bottom of the hole in the Base.
5. Line up the holes of the Bottom Clamp to the corresponding holes of the Top Clamp, so that the clamps form a circle around the bicylce handle.
6. Screw in 4 M5 x 15 mm screws into the holes and add 4 M5 nuts to each screw.
7. Place 1 Spring-Loaded Knob into the Notch in the Rotator so that the extruded part of the Knob runs vertically.
8. While holding the Knob in place in the Rotator, add a 9/32" x 3/4" compression spring into the other Notch in the Rotator. 
9. Place the reamining Knob into remaining open Notch in the same orientation as the first Knob.
10. While compressing both Knobs, place the rotator into the Rotator Hole. Rotate the Rotator until the Knobs click into place.
11. Place the Cap over the Rotator and align the holes to the corresponding holes in the Top Clamp. Screw in 4 M5 x 15 mm screws into the holes.
